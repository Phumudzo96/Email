# Email

In this task, we’re going to be simulating an email message. Some of the logic has
been ﬁlled out for you in the email.py ﬁle.

Open the ﬁle called email.py.

Create a class deﬁnition for an
Email
which has four variables:
has_been_read
,
email_contents
,
is_spam
and
from_address
.

The constructor should initialise the sender’s email address.

The constructor should also initialise
has_been_read
and
is_spam
to false.

Create a function in this class called
mark_as_read
which should change
has_been_read
to true.

Create a function in this class called
mark_as_spam
which should change
is_spam
to true.

Create a list called
inbox
to store all emails (note that you can have a list of
objects).

Then create the following methods:

○ add_email
- which takes in the contents and email address f rom the
received email to make a new
Email
object.

○ get_count
- returns the number of messages in the store.

○ get_email
- returns the contents of an email in the list. For this, allow
the user to input an index i.e.
get_email(i)
returns the email stored
at position
i
in the list. Once this has been done,
has_been_read
should now be true.

○ get_unread_emails
- should return a list of all the emails that haven’t
been read.

○ get_spam_emails
- should return a list of all the emails that have been
marked as spam.

○ delete
- deletes an email in the inbox.
Now that you have these set up, let’s get everything working!

Fill in the rest of the logic for what should happen when the user inputs
send/read/quit. Some of it has been done for you.
